### About the app

This is a basic react app. The goal of the game is to click on as many unique pictures as possible. Each time the user makes a guess the images reshuffle. If the user clicks on an image that has not been click on before then their score goes up by one. If they click on an image that has already been clicked on then the game starts over and their score resets to zero. Their top score will persist throughout each round.
